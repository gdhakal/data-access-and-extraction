# Tabular Data EDA

Classification task: Classify a given flower 

Vocabularies:
1) Vector: n-dimensional numerical array
2) Dataset: Table
3) Feature/Variable/Input-variable/Independent-variable: column names
4) Label/Dependent-variable/output-variable/class/class-label/response label: classification text

[4, 5, 6, 7] -> 4 dimentional array -> 2 dimensional vector

What is 1-D vector? Scalar.
Instead of writing x = [5], we can write x = 5

Domain knowledge is important.
