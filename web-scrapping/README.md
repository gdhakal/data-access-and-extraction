# Web Scrapping

Web scrapping is used to collect data from any website on the Internet. Web scrapping is to perform data analysis and present it in a useful format such as:

- Show the best deals and rank them.
- Web scrape reviews from online store.
- Web scrape game stats and players record.
- Get info of a person from Wikipedia.

We should perform web scrapping on the standardized dom elements so that we can effectively navigate through the html tree. Edge cases should be handled with if conditions and try catch block.
